### A little more about me:

I'm also part of a interest group in my college named [LACIQ](https://www.instagram.com/laciq.ufpe?igsh=dGJ0Nnh6b3Q2c2c=) where we research, teach and learn about quantum computing, trying to bring the world of this new paradigm in IT to the eyes of the public!
Besides quantum computing, I'm very interested to learn more about Computer graphics and Embedded systems, as these are topics that seem very challenging and fascinating.
